These files are dedicated to run on a seperate SOC in the same LAN than the mainprogram.
It will receive the wx-json string and write an aprx compatible string to send it as a beacon string.
Therefore the very short bash script will call the string. The script must be includes in aprx.conf as a beacon,
Sample:
<beacon>
    beaconmode  aprsis
    cycle-size  3m
    beacon via WIDE2-1 \
    srccall DB0TGO-14 \
    exec <path-to-script>/APRS_wx.sh
</beacon>
